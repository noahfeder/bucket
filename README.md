# Bucket runs around!

#### A cute little Chrome extension for a cute little Bucket.

[Evan Dahm](http://www.rice-boy.com/) created Bucket, an adorable bucket-person. Evan also happened to make a spritesheet for it. I made a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bucket-runs-around/nmefobbhfadgnohckbiaodelpdenjped) so Bucket can run around the websites of your choosing. Use WASD or &larr;&uarr;&darr;&rarr; to make him run around, and space to make him sit down.

Chrome extension itself can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bucket-runs-around/nmefobbhfadgnohckbiaodelpdenjped).
